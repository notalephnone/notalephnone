# Who
My github repo names change constantly because I am really bad a picking a username :)

I'm AMT from the Canadian Rockies 🍁 and I like Computational Applied Mathematics (so mathematical modeling, statistics, data science, analytics and intelligence)  
My favourite colour is #ffb219

# What
My current projects are focused around IoT systems, data management and niche data topics (Live-streaming, video games and pop-culture).
Working on a blog to yap about these and cleaning my git skills too.
